## How to access the notebooks

The notebooks in this repository accompany the article "Keeping it under lock and keywords: Exploring new ways to open up the Web Archives with Notebooks". This article was submitted to the Archival Science special issue "Challenges and Prospects of Born-digital and Digitized Archives in the Digital Humanities".

There are a number of options for viewing and interacting with the notebooks:
* Github: open directly in Github. This is not recommended as not all visualisations will render.
* NBViewer.org: a static rendering of the notebooks for reading their contents

****** NOTE: there is currently an issue accessing the Discovery API from the Google Cloud Platform which means it is not possible to refresh the Discovery data in Notebook 1 using Colab or MyBinder. This is a temporary situation which will be resolved soon ******
* Google Colabs: a Google hosted notebook environment allowing a viewer to edit and run executable sections of the notebook. Requires a Google account
* MyBinder: a cloud hosted notebook environment, offering a similar experience to Colabs

To view Notebook 1 in NBViewer, follow this link:

To view Notebook 2 in NBViewer, follow this link:

Both Colabs and MyBinder notebooks are fully interactive allowing a user to execute code blocks, and edit the code within them. Both environments are relatively intuitive to use, and both have a keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Enter to execute a block of code. It is highly recommended to execute the blocks in order as many are dependent on the results of previous blocks.
